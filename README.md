## About JSON data

**JavaScript** is the most widely used language that powers interactions
between client devices and server/web applications, where it allows
programmers to implement complex features<sup>1</sup>. As a high-level
language, it is also light-weight<sup>2</sup>.  
JavaScript Object Notation (**JSON**), as its name also implies, is a
type of data that is easily converted from and to **JavaScript**
objects<sup>3</sup>. **JSON** is stored as text string, which makes it
possible to store **JavaScript** objects as text. It is now a very
standard way for data communication over the network, which used to be
primarily with **XML** format that is much heavier in weight.  
As described, **JSON** was built with purpose of being a standardized
transfer language that is easy for human to read and at the same time
easy for machine to parse and execute <sup>4</sup>.  
The flexibility of **JSON** means itâ€™s also suitable for general data
transfer beyond **JavaScript** objects between devices across the web.
This makes it a popular way for accessing data through cloud where
**JSON API** is implemented<sup>5</sup>.
